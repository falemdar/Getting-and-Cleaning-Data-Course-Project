## Variables
* **subject** Subject ID that was measured (1-30)
* **activity** Activity type during the measurements


The rest of the variables are the averages of the estimates from the the individual sets of measurement of the signals pertaining the subject and the activity type (as denoted by the *"_avg"* tag at the end of the name of the variable. '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. The two estimates used each instance of measurement sets in this dataset were _mean_ and _std_. 


_mean()_ denotes that the estimate was the mean value of the measurement set, and _std()_ indicates that the estimate was the standard deviation.


The values from these signals were used to calculate the averages of estimated variables:

* tBodyAcc-XYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc
* fBodyAccJerk
* fBodyGyro
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyBodyGyroMag
* fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag

The measurement data comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset v1.0 (see: [Source](#source)). For more information about this dataset contact: activityrecognition@smartlab.ws

Here is some relevant description from the original dataset:


The features listed come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
