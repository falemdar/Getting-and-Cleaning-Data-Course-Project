This project is the final assignment of the Coursera class _Getting and Cleaning Data_. It takes in a number of data files and merges them. After filtering the relevant columns, labeling the variables, factoring some variables and tidying the dataset, it outputs a tidy summary dataset.


* _run_analysis.R_ takes in the input files and produces a tidy dataset that only contains the averages of selected variables per subject and activity type.

* _tidy_dataset.txt_ is the output of the script â€“ it is the final tidy dataset.

* _CodeBook.md_ gives the description of the variables in the output tidy dataset (_tidy_dataset.txt_).

* _variables.txt_ lists the names of the variables in the output tidy dataset (_tidy_dataset.txt_).

* The original dataset can be found in the final course project link of the Coursera class _Getting and Cleaning Data_.
